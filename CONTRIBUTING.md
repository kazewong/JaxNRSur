### Expectations

JaxNRSur is developed and maintained in my spare time and, while I try to be
responsive, I don't always get to every issue immediately. If it has been more
than a week or two, feel free to ping me (@kazewong) to try to get my attention. This is subject to changes as the community grows.

### Did you find a bug?

**Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under
[Issues](https://github.com/kazewong/JaxNRSur/issues). If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new
one](https://github.com/kazewong/JaxNRSur/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title
and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and the
simplest possible **code sample** demonstrating the expected behavior that is
not occurring. Also label the issue with the bug label.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch. Ensure the PR description clearly
describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if
applicable.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing feature?

Based on the scope of this package, we do not intend to add and maintain too many features to this code base. 
It will be good to first open an issue to describe the feature to see whether it is aligned with the package's scope. If it is, open a new GitHub pull request with the feature or change. Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### Do you intend to introduce an example or tutorial?

Open a new GitHub pull request with the example or tutorial. The example should
be self-contained and keep imports from other packages to a minimum. Leave the
case-specific analysis detail out. For more extensive tutorials, we encourage the community to link minimal examples hosted on the JaxNRSur documentation to
documentation from other packages.

### Do you have question about the code?

Please open an issue on GitHub.
